CustomerApi is a .NET 8 Web API project designed to manage customer and account data. It exposes RESTful HTTP endpoints that allow you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) customers and accounts. It uses a relational database (SQLite) for persistent storage and integrates with EF Core as the ORM layer.
